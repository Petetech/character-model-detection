Character Model Detection
=========================
Using the Unity game engine to detect characters in images/screenshots with a list of provided parameters.
=========================

In this project we will be leveraging Unity to do the following things:

- Create images/screenshots of characters to be used as practice or training for the program. 
- The image takes the place of the real life application.
- Create an automatic element to generate scenes that will be used in comparison with the images.
- These scenes will make use of multiple camera angles and lighting angles to simulate the different possibilities.

- Most importantly, the scene models will be based off only the character outline, not a rectangle surrounding the model.


A more basic explanation:

- Take a picture
- Create models of different appearances
- The area in the picture that is of closest match is our 'person'

=========================

The expected result should be greater accuracy in detection due to the use of character outlines and no surrounding area.
